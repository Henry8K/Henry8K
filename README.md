<!--=== Introduction ===-->

# üëã ‚Ä¢ Introduction

> Hi, I'm Henry, an application developer working on both back-end and front-end. I started my programming journey at the age of 14 with the goal of creating a server for Minecraft, which led me to learn PHP. From there, I started to expand my knowledge in several programming languages.

> Currently, I have experience in several languages, including PHP, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL. In addition, I am skilled in frameworks such as React Native and Bootstrap, and have knowledge in tools such as Git and Github. I am currently learning Python. Oh, and i use vs code in light theme :D.

# ‚≠ê ‚Ä¢ Minecraft

> As a big fan of Minecraft I focus on big projects related to this area and that in general help the community, it may not seem like it, but I have many related projects that are private because I only publish them when I already have a beta version pre-defined to only do fixes and maintenance shortly after.

> I am currently working with a pendency of 7 big projects related to plugins, bots and much more in the Minecraft area and some of them are planned to be released soon... I hope to continue helping the whole community with their needs for a long time...

# üèÜ ‚Ä¢ Performance

> This is one of my profile stats, I preferred to leave only this one since it's the only one I value more, I like this system a lot and I try never to lose the streaks that took me so long to get :D, so if you have ideas of projects that would be useful for the whole community and not only for you create an issue in my profile README so I can possibly implement or send me an email!
