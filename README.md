## ðŸ‘‹ - Introduction

> Hello, my name is Henry Thierry and I'm a developer since 2020, currently I have 3 years of experience in several programming languages and I'm a full stack developer, I like to create Frameworks, Artificial Intelligences and websites :D, Currently I'm working with Python, Java and JavaScript and I hope to learn other languages soon. I started working with PHP more because I wanted to create my own minecraft server so I needed to learn how to program in this language and that's where I started.

## ðŸš€ - Skills

> Languages: Basically I know several programming languages in general, I started with **PHP** so my knowledge about it is huge and soon after I moved on to **Java** which I use more nowadays, along with **JavaScript**, besides that I have knowledge of **HTML/CSS**, **SQL**, **EDA** and among others.

> Platforms: I'm honest most of the time and tell what I think. I don't like to create things with frameworks, but I know all the syntax of the main frameworks like React Native, Bootstrap, Bulma and others, I can easily develop code with them without the need for external coding. Also I know how to use git and github completely.

> Other: To finish I would like to highlight a few more points that I know how to do and that I am still developing over time, the first point is design, I know how to do good designs and prototypes for both modern and classic sites, I always look for a customized and different theme for each site. Basically I know English and Portuguese and I develop **SEO**.
