<!--=== Introduction ===-->

# ðŸ‘‹ â€¢ Introduction

> -> Hi, I'm Henry, an application developer working on both back-end and front-end. I started my programming journey at the age of 14 with the goal of creating a server for Minecraft, which led me to learn PHP. From there, I started to expand my knowledge in several programming languages.

> -> Currently, I have experience in several languages, including PHP, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL. In addition, I am skilled in frameworks such as React Native and Bootstrap, and have knowledge in tools such as Git and Github. I am currently learning Python. I use vs code theme light :D.
